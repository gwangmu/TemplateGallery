# Template Gallery

This repository is for people who want to get their things done as effortlessly
as possible, or just want to learn from working examples. I try to specify where
the code is from (if it was), but sometimes I skip it if I can't remember where
it's from or if it's too basic. Contact me if you think your source code is in
this repository without acknowledgment.

This is my little hobby. The list will be extended from time to time.
